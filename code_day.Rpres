What does this pipeline do?
========================================================

Once you have retrieved all your sequences from the Illumina machine, you will need to asign them to the sample they came from,  and minimize the noise and cross-contamination inherent to this platform.

This pipeline will need the follwing **input** files:

- One or more pairs of fastq files
- A metadata file, with one row per sample, containing the information needed to demultiplex the sequences
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
metadata <- read_csv("data/metadata.csv")
metadata %>% select (sample_id, Tag, pri_index_name, sec_index_seq, file1, file2)
```
- A parameters file, which will be the bridge between the pipeline and the metadata file 

What does this pipeline give you?
========================================================

In return, this pipeline will give you the composition of your samples. The **output** files are:

- ASV_Table: It is in a long format, with three columns: Hash, sample, nReads

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ASV.table <- read_csv("output_training/ASV_table.csv")

ASV.table
```

- Hash_key: In case you used hashing, the key to convert sequences to hashes

```{r, echo=F}

Hash.key <- read_csv("output_training/hash_key.csv")

Hash.key

```
- A bunch of summary files and general clutter

Getting started
========================================================





- Download the last version of the pipeline. If you use git or github, open the terminal and type 

`git clone https://github.com/ramongallego/demultiplexer_for_DADA2.git <directory>`

If not, you can just browse to  https://github.com/ramongallego/demultiplexer_for_DADA2 and use the ZIP download option

- Before we started using dada2 for clustering sequences, we used jimmy O'donnell's pipeline. You can get it at

`git clone https://github.com/jimmyodonnell/banzai.git <directory2>`



Dependencies
========================================================

Here is a list of dependencies you should have for running both pipelines

- cutadapt

- vsearch 

- swarm

- seqtk

- blast+

- python

- pandoc

- and a lot of **R** packages:
  
    - data.table
    - devtools
    - reshape2
    - vegan
    - taxize
    - tidyverse
    - stringr
    - dada2
    - Biostrings
    - digest
    - rmarkdown
    - knitr

The parameters file
========================================================

The parameters file tells the script where to look for the appropiate information in the metadata file, and allows you to choose amongst different options for your run.

We will go through them later on, but for now we will have to focus on one:

```{r, out.width = '80%', fig.align = 'center', echo = F}

knitr::include_graphics("code_day-figure/Screen Shot 2018-08-28 at 8.08.55 AM.png")

```

This directory must exist in your drive, so if you haven't created one, do it now.

Doing a test Run: demultiplexer_for_dada2
========================================================

Just to check that you have installed everything you need, let's do a test run

`bash <ppath/to/dir>/demultiplex_both_fastqs.sh <path/to/dir>/banzai_params_for_dada2.sh`

The test run takes about two minutes to run, and you should see it progress like this

```{r, out.width = '55%', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("code_day-figure/Screen Shot 2018-08-27 at 5.21.22 PM.png")

```


Doing a test Run: banzai
======================================


Similar concept, just try 

`bash <path/to/dir>/banzai.sh test`

If you succeed, you should see 

```{r, out.width = '55%', fig.align = 'center', echo = F}

knitr::include_graphics("code_day-figure/Screen Shot 2018-08-27 at 6.25.04 PM.png")

```


The pipeline script
====================

- The first part looks for the parameters file, the metadata file and creates all the directory it needs to get started

- Then, under the READ METADATA section, it loads all the info from the metadata file
